## Why should people buy Decred?

Decred is a digital currency designed to be a superior long-term store of value. It's hybrid consensus system mixes Proof-of-Work mining and Proof-of-Stake voting to provide an additional layer of network security and enable stakeholders to control budget and policy. 

Decred's hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism, transparent proposal and voting system, and continually funded treasury make it secure, adaptable, and sustainable.

## Why not just PoW?

The hybrid system allows Decred to be fork-resistant and twenty times more expensive to attack than PoW only networks. It also enables built-in formalized governance that allows changing the consensus rules while avoiding hard forks. And the decentralized treasury that gets 10% of the block rewards allow the Decred project to be self-sustainable, allowing developers to focus on their own agenda and not third-party interests.

## **When was Decred first launched?**

Decred launched on February 8, 2016. All upgrade decisions since then 
have been approved by a super majority of the stakeholders so that no 
hard forks have ever been necessary.

## What's Decred vision?

Decred's vision is to build a self-directed, decentralized future ruled 
by the collective intelligence of the community. It will be built upon 
the pillars of sovereignty, fairness, transparency, inclusivity, 
privacy, and security. Everyone can vote on the rules and project-level 
decision making proportionately to their stake, yielding decisions and 
policies in the best interest of all - not just a select few.

## Is Decred a DAO?

Yes, the Decred community considers itself as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and works towards decentralizing the whole governance process. As it moves towards becoming a DAO, Decred is intentionally designed to fund all the parties involved in its governance. Each block reward compensates miners, stakeholders, and the Treasury, which pays contractors who work on Decred.

Every Decred community member with "skin in the game" - stakeholders, 
developers, and miners - can vote on the direction of the project. 
Stakeholders collectively determine the policy, development plan, 
budget, and consensus rule changes. They also approve the miners' work -
effectively aligning interests to ensure the best possible outcome for 
all.

## **Why haven't I ever heard of Decred?**

Decred has been quietly building over the past 3.5 years. This has 
allowed the community to focus on creating a superior long-term store of
value that will stand on its own - marketing can't substitute for a 
great product.
